## Missed Connection
<details>
  <summary>
You, the savvy and, _if I may say_, well-dressed founder trawling GitHub
for your next 10x hire, spotted my waggish red dog and shrewedly chose
to investigate the profile of a creative and handsome (_though modest_)
programmer. ...
  </summary>


Saddled as you were with an overabundance of capital and a ravenous appetite
for innovation, you astutely intuited that a character such as myself,
possessing of high skills and low morals, could offer a return on investment
many times greater than the substantial monthly outlay that I clearly command.

"A man for our time," you wisely mused, "the hero we need, indeed, in this
era of rabid corruption and venal capitalism." Like a storm building on the
horizon, the air acquired a new energy; a palatable tang to its taste and
a complimentary zig to your zag. You felt the key slot into the lock, your
professional soulmate revealed at last.

"Virtue be damned!" you shouted, breathless and suddenly wide-awake, the
realization ringing in your ears like the crack of thunder rolling across Puget
Sound. Did I say Seattle? I meant San Francisco Bay.

With the poise of a barrel fisherman armed with a sawed-off shotgun and a
bucket of M80s [you feverishly clicked through my project list, each a shining
paragon of elegance, efficiency, and leak-free abstraction](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=language%3Anim+user%3Adisruptek&s=updated&type=Repositories).

As your heartbeat quickened, and let's be frank, I'm obviously not the first
diamond you've found in the rough, _this brilliant, firey gem_ provoked a
headrush the likes of which you'd known only once before; you remember, that
night in Bangkok during your gap year... Oh, what a night.

Repos raptured; comely, captivating commits confounding concentrated, critical
comparison. Enthralled excitement embossed each exquisite entry, and file by
file, fascination fomented -- figuratively, anyway.  Just stay with me, here:

You swoon at my syntax. You climax at my comments. You leer lustfully at my
luscious loops as my types titillate and tantalize. Objectified, uh, objects
overload in variables variably voluptuous and vulgar. Simply savage, salacious
software; seven-layer soft-core smut, surely, if I do say so, with sober
sincerity and significant self-effacement.

"Illicit illiteration intrigues," you illustrate, "but must ultimately yield
to practicality." A wave of clarity overtakes you at last, quenching your heat
and steeling your resolve. You **absolutely must** get this coder on payroll.
"Immediately, if not sooner," you quip.  Ha ha!  You're so witty!

Trembling, you gulp down your fear of rejection, text your CFO to prepare
for a long weekend of creative accounting, and dial the digits...

_happy ending left as an exercise for the reader_
